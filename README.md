# Message_Passing_Graph_System

This repo stores my work of creating a message bassing based graph processing system utilizing the gem5 simulator. The graphs directory contains a place for graphs to be imported, generated, sorted, and stored. Then gem5 is used to run SSSP on these graphs. The C++ source files that run SSSP can b e found in configs/William/graph_src/batching.
